"As the tenure of current Government draws to a close, there is no progress on negotiations for a peace accord with Naga armed groups, with talks stuck for almost a year due to an intransigent position taken by the Naga side on symbolic issues, such as a separate flag, reports Indian Express on January 7. According to reports, substantive issues had been resolved between the two sides and a draft agreement was almost ready by then. But a change in Naga position has led to apprehensions that any gains made since 2014 will be lost with a change in political dispensation at the Centre. According to sources, the current logjam is largely due to the Church, which has taken a lead role in articulating the Naga political position in the past year. The Church has argued that symbols are integral to the identity of the Nagas, and that Naga identity would not be safe without them.It is politically unviable for the Centre to accept demands such as a separate Naga flag, even though, sources said, it has agreed to guarantee protection of the Naga identity. But if these changes can be brought later through a democratic political process, the Centre would have no objection, sources explained.",
"At a Church-organised meeting held in Dimapur on September 8 2018, Naga civil society groups and political groups had issued a statement called the Declaration of the Naga Collective Spirit. It said that the historical fact that the Naga struggle started before Indias independence strengthens our moral authority and argued that the Naga people did not violate any agreement for union made with any nation in our history. This establishes the legitimacy and integrity of Naga rights.In what is seen as a repudiation of the argument that Nagas have to be realistic about being a part of India, the declaration noted: We draw inspiration from Confucius who reminds us that, When it is obvious that goals cannot be achieved, dont adjust the goals, but adjust the steps.Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), comprising representatives of six influential Naga rebel groups and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) or NSCN-IM, had met interlocutors of the Central government last month, and another meeting is scheduled in Delhi this month. But neither side is hopeful of a breakthrough, in light of the political narrative being articulated in Nagaland.",
"The Centre had agreed to find a solution on the basis of mutually agreed sovereignty rights, which would take the unique history of Nagas into account, adds Indian Express. Among the substantive issues agreed upon by the two sides was creation of a cultural council for all the Nagas, removal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), enhancing political representation of Nagas in Parliament, creation of a bicameral state legislature, autonomous council for Naga-majority areas in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh and major economic packages for the state of Nagaland.

"Legal trouble for Bengali Hindu migrants, who have taken shelter in India, may not be over, with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) recommending that those seeking citizenship will have to first prove that they are victims of religious persecution while applying for citizenship, reports Assam Tribune on January 11. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, was passed by the Lok Sabha (lower house of Indian Parliament) early this week and is now pending passage in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Indian Parliament). Director of Intelligence Bureau (IB) told Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) stated that If they had not declared so at that time of their arrival in India, it would be difficult for them to make such a claim now. JPC report said that when asked to state the fate of other people belonging to minority communities who have come to India from the three countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan) under reference due to religious persecution but have not declared so at the time of their arrival in India, the Intelligence Bureau submitted that any future claim would be enquired into, including through Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) before a decision is taken.",
"So far only 31,313 people have formally declared that they came to India due to religious persecution. The IB Director deposed: Yes, because they have claimed, they have applied. There will be many others who might have come and they might have already taken citizenship by various means. They might have obtained passport, ration card. All other documents they might have obtained and they might have already registered themselves in the voters list. So, for all practical purposes, they are already citizens of this country. Tribunals are already there to identify if any of them has obtained it by fraudulent means. The Bill is for those who have applied and who have claimed that they have been persecuted in their respective country.",
"The Committee then enquired whether all those who had applied would be granted citizenship once the Bill was passed or further verifications would be carried out. In response, the IB Director submitted: Sir, as and when the Bill is passed, one thing can be thought of is that all those who have applied, who are here for a number of years, we can make one more verification whether during their stay in India if anything adverse has come to the notice of the security agencies whether it is IB, local police, local intelligence and those who have come for any activities or there is notice of any activities which is prejudicial of the nation, their case can be scrutinised. But that we will examine separately.",
"When the Committee desired to hear the views of RAW, its Joint Secretary deposed in evidence: ... our only concern has been that the agencies, which are inimical to us should not have a legal framework within which they can exploit our situation and infiltrate their own people into our own country. That is a matter of great concern for us.The Committee enquired whether it was absolutely necessary to confer citizenship on the migrants as conferring political rights had larger implications and whether it would be prudent to accord refugee or temporary resident status to the migrants.In reply, the MHA submitted as under: Conferment of citizenship to foreign migrants living in India with valid documents ensures more facilities and power to exercise franchise and feel their responsibilities towards the nation. Since India is not a signatory to the UN Convention, 1951 or its Protocol of 1967, it may not be prudent to treat them as refugees if rules permit that they could be allowed to acquire Indian citizenship.On the same issue, the Legislative Department submitted: The proposed Bill does not directly confer citizenship on these persons, it merely provides these persons the opportunity to be considered for the grant of certificate of naturalisation. It has become necessary to exempt these persons from being treated as illegal migrants in order to ensure that they may avail of the opportunity to be considered for naturalisation under Section 6 read with the Third Schedule to the said Act.In response to another related query, the MHA apprised as under: As of now, illegal migrants have not been conferred with Indian Citizenship. However, after enactment of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, it will enable illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian Citizenship under Section 5 (1) (a) (Registration) and 6 (Naturalisation) of the Citizenship Act, 1955.

"According to a report, a special group headed by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)'s Muzzamil Bhat from Sialkot in Pakistan and his lackeys made forays into Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka between 2005 and 2007, knowing well that these areas could be used to further their agenda and to target India, reports The New Indian Express on May 7. The Indian state had been following Islamic militancy in Sri Lanka since 2004.The tipping point in the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Sri-Lanka had LeT foot prints all over it. Muzzamil Bhat one of the planners of 26/11 and is reported to be the architect of the Chittisinghpora massacre. The entire construct of this planto use these countries as a launch pad to train terrorists was part of his larger architecture.The FBI in its 26/11 charge sheet named Bhat as D, a key LeT military commander, who was involved in the Chittisinghpora massacre in Jammu and Kashmir on the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to India in March 2000.",
"In its second chargesheet, filed in a Chicago court, the FBI named an ISI officer, Major Iqbal, and four LeT operatives - SajidMajeed, Abu Qahafa, Abu Alqama and the unknown Lashkar member 'D'. About 'D' the charge sheet states that after the arrest of Zaki-ur-RehmanLakhvi in Pakistan in connection with the 26/11 attacks, he became the overall operational commander of LeT. According to FBI, 'D', who is yet to be arrested by Pakistan, was a handler of David Coleman Headley. Headley told Indian investigators that Muzzamil was involved in the Chittisinghpora massacre. In turn, Headley also said Muzzamil was most trustworthy lieutenant of Lakhvi and apart from Chittisinghpora killings of Sikhs, he planned the Akshardham temple attack in September 2002.Bhat, on the other hand, is a planner and his understanding was that with Indian intelligence and security forces keeping a close vigil on southern India in those years, he reckoned that taking the training camps offshore would be a better idea. Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) was already active in southern India, they had set up a southern chapter across the four states, while Bhatkal had become a new centrifuge.Muzzamil arrived in Sri Lanka and quickly realized that there was traction amongst Tamil Muslims after the Tsunami, and in Bangladesh among the Rohingyas between 2004-2008.But Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) which was extremely active in both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka did not allow Bhat or his henchmen to stabilize their operations. In 2011, ably abetted and assisted by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) officer Amir Zubair Siddiqui (Counselor in the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo), a new name popped up on the radar - Zakir Hussain - who began to actively consort with and recruit Tamil Muslims on the island.",

Siddiqui was arrested for allegedly conspiring to attack vital establishments in India and was quietly withdrawn before the NIA's request under Mutual Assistance Legal Treaty (MLAT) reached Colombo.The terror plot was uncovered after the NIA police personnel arrested an ISI agent Mohammed Zakir Hussain (37) through the 'Q' Branch of the Tamil Nadu police in 2013. The reason was that he was gathering details about vital installations in Tamil Nadu and sent photographs to Siddiqui. Hussain used his counterparts Sivabalan and Mohammad Salim to circulate Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in the state.During questioning, Hussain also confessed that he had also used Rafeeque (29) to pump in FICN in the state.A much larger network of Maldivians, Sri Lankan Muslims and Malaysian Tamils was discovered through this overarching probe.",2019

India was represented by Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

"Reported Pakistani actions against terrorists and terror groups have exposed the countrys complicity in using terrorism as a tool of statecraft, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on July 4, reports The Hindu. MEAs official spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar said that Islamabad should take irreversible steps against the groups that are responsible for incidents like the 26/11 Mumbai attack. Pakistan claims that they have taken steps against terrorists and terrorist outfits, but when it comes to taking action against the people that we have demanded, they go into a denial mode, they even deny that they exist in their country. On the other hand, they try to show the international community that they are taking some action against terrorist groups operating from their soil. They stand completely exposed as far as their claim of taking steps against terrorist groups in Pakistan is concerned, said Raveesh Kumar. He also said that Pakistans announced financial crackdown on banned militant groups is not sufficient.",

The steps against the terror outfits were undertaken just days after Pakistan faced the heat at the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) and barely escaped from being blacklisted. Pakistan faced the threat of getting blacklisted after FATF pointed out that it had neither investigated nor taken action against UN proscribed terrorists like Hafiz Saeed.
